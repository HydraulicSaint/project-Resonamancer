# Project Resonamancer

**Resonamancer** is an experimental framework for understanding and recreating the essence of music.  
It breaks songs down into their spectral fingerprints — isolating vocals, drums, bass, and more — then analyzes rhythm, harmony, timbre, and dynamics to uncover what makes a track resonate.  

The goal: to turn personal taste into a quantifiable *sound genome*, and use it as a creative engine.  
From artist to producer, Resonamancer helps bridge the gap between the **song in your soul** and the **song the world hears**.

## Core Features (planned)
- 🎶 **Stem Separation** — isolate instruments/vocals using Demucs or Spleeter.
- 🔬 **Spectral & Rhythmic Analysis** — extract tempo, key, harmony, timbre, and dynamics.
- 🧬 **Taste Profiling** — build unique "sound DNA" across multiple songs.
- 🛠️ **Creative Feedback** — compare new recordings against your profile for alignment + suggestions.
- 📊 **Visualization Tools** — spectrograms, chord maps, energy flows.

## Deployment
Resonamancer is designed to run in a **Dockerized container**, deployable locally or remotely.  
Aiming for a modular architecture (FastAPI, Celery, Postgres, Redis, MinIO) with GPU acceleration optional.
